# Advance Calculater

# Introduction:-
Advance calculator can works  for integer , float,double inputs. This project allow users to calculate Advance function of mathematics ,they are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division but in this Project which I'm Implementing ,also included  additional advance operations such as Factorial, Power ,modulas ,Derivatives,Integration,Quadratic Equations and Base Conversion .However, in the 
advace calcualater user input are used.

The switch-case statement is used to write a simple calculator program in C language. The remainder operator % is normally used with data values. To print the remainder operator %% is used in the first printf() function. The variable ch store the operator, similarly the variables num1, and num2 stores the two numbers. The switch has condition “ch” so the entered operator is matched with which case label those case label statements are executed, and display result to the screen. If the entered operator is not matched with the case labels then the default statement will be executed and it will display the message “Error! Invalid Operator.” to the screen

# Swot Analysis 

STRENGTHS

The ultimate strength Calculators is its innovative,user-friendly and long lasting and can be used for Engineering Student

WEAKNESSES

do not include all types of Derivatives and Integration.

OPPORTUNITIES

The tech-based market has a huge opportunities in capturing the youth market. And this calculator comparatively already one step ahead than other

THREATS

The slower growth in technological innovation will also bring a significant threat in the upcoming dynamic world.
